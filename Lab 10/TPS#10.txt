TPS #1


1. Cache helps store data and we need it so we can access it later
2. N/A
3. N/A
4. The number of bits in an offset is 16. There are 16bits in an offset as a function of block size. It is not practical to have a cache of block size 1.
5. We need 64 index bits and need 64 buts in index as a function of number of blocks
6. Yes, you know by multiplying both of them
7. It will be needed for the tag?
8. The main memory is 1MB, offset bits is 3bits, number of blocks is 16, number of index bits are 4, number of tag bits is 14

TPS #2
1. It takes longer and requires more than any other cache
2. N/A
3. The number of bits in an index needed is 8 bits
4. 2
   1. 1 mb
   2. 3 bit
   3. 16 blocks
   4. 15bits
   5. 14bits
